Class critique:


Good:

Wow, you must have worked hard on this!
This tells a deep story.
The soulful gaze of the goat is doing something to me.
It’s peam!
Expressive brushwork!
I can see this in a gallery!




Bad:

The colours could use some refining.
I think that it’s… unique?
This looks more rushed than energetic.
Is this like, anime?
I think it’s weird. 
You should make this into an NFT.
A buddy of mine needs a logo for his pocket knife business, you should talk to him.
